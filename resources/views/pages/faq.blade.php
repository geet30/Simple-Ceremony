                  <p class="body-3-regular">Anyone from any country around the world can get married in Australia. It makes no difference if you are a resident or citizen of Australia or just visiting for the day.<br><br>
                  only criteria you need to fulfil is;<br><br>
                  you must be 18 years old. In some cases, if one of the parties is 17, it may be possible - talk to your celebrant about this.<br>
                  not already legally married in Australia or any other country around the world.<br>
                  the couple are not in a 'Prohibited Relationship". This generally refers to a close family relationship.<br>
                  both parties are freely choosing to get married.

                  <h4 class="h4 mb-3">2. What are the steps to getting married in Australia?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">Getting married, through Simple Ceremonies, is the simplest way to get married in Australia. There are just 3 steps.</p>
                  <p class="button-1 turquoise-100 mb-3">Step 1 - Make your Booking</p>
                  <p class="button-1 turquoise-100 mb-3">Step 2 - Complete NoIM</p>
                  <p class="button-1 turquoise-100 mb-3">Step 3 - Love Your Ceremony</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">3. What is the Notice of Intended Marriage form or NoIM?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">The NoIM is a form that is required to be completed, signed, witnessed and provided to your marriage celebrant, at least one calendar month prior to your ceremony date. </p>
                  <p class="button-1 turquoise-100 mb-0">This form can be completed on-line here, once you have made your booking</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">4. Who needs to sign and witness your NoIM?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">Each party to the marriage needs to sign the NoIM. However, if both parties cannot  conveniently have their signature witnessed by the Authorised Person, at this stage (Example. one party is outside of Australia or interstate)  - one party will suffice. Then on the day of your ceremony the other party will sign and have their signature witnessed by their marriage celebrant. The NoIM needs to be signed, witnessed and given to the marriage celebrant at least one calendar month prior to the ceremony date.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">5. How much notice do you need to give to get married?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">By law in Australia, everyone getting married needs to give at least ONE CALENDAR MONTH notice. This must be done by providing your marriage celebrant with a completed, signed and witnessed NoIM.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">6. Can the notice period be shortened?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-0">Depending on your situation you can shorten the notice period (normally, one calendar month) if you meet certain criteria covered by Schedule 3 of the Marriage Regulations.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">7. I have booked to get married at the Marriage Registry Office (BDM) but now want to get married with Simple Ceremonies.</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-0">This is not a problem at all - we would love to marry you in a beautiful location.<br><br>
                     When are you planning on getting marrried?
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">8. MORE than one calendar month from today?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-0">If your ceremony date is more than one calendar month from today, even if you have already lodged your NoIM with BDM, it is simplier and cheaper just to start from scratch. Just click here and make your booking and then you will be directed to complete your NoIM online, with us.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">9. LESS than one calendar month from today?</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-0">
                     If your ceremony date is less than one calendar month from today - we can still help you out.<br>
                     The process is as follows:<br><br>
                     a) Conact us and will will provide you with a link to book your desired date.<br><br>
                     b) Once you have booked we can then prepare a letter for your to give to BDM - requesting that they transfer your NoIM to us.<br><br>
                     c) You will then just need to email BDM at this address - bdm-marriages-SYD@customerservice.nsw.gov.au<br><br>
                     Inform them that you would like to change your arrangements and request that they transfer the NoIM to us and attach the letter we have provided to you. Please provide them with any details you have of your existing booking.<br><br>
                     d) They will then arrange to charge you the transfer fee (they charge $110) . Once this has been paid they will contact us direct to let us know that the NoIM has been transferred.<br><br>
                     This needs to be done before we can marry you.
