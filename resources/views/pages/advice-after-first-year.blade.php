                  Yes still very happy and living our best lives now we are together.<br><br>
                  My advice for newly weds is this:<br><br>
                  There has to be chemistry in a relationship to have that spark️ that little thing inside you that spreads like a warmth thru your soul.<br><br>
                  To cuddle and laugh often and just love being in each others company is just the best reasons ever to unite by getting married and honouring the love you feel towards your partner.<br><br>
                  Every Friday night Is date night and we have just found this date night to be something special to look forward to every week. It keeps the relationship fresh n bright. We live for date nights........so thats my helpful hints for newly wedded people.<br><br>
                  Cheers

                  We got married during the pandemic, which was not our first option. But we make it happened, because our love is stronger and we just can’t wait to seal the deal!<br><br>
                  Be realistic, flexible, compromise and have fun! Things may go wrong but take a deep breath. It works out at the end, so enjoy the most precious day of your life! It is important to relax and chill, especially for the bride so you would not be a bridezilla

                        Well marriage certainly has its challenges. I guess the most important learning is learning how to communicate with each other openly because at the end of the day we are each other's best friend. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 endometriosis after we got married so this has been a long roller coaster ride. Certainly not the free easy going time we were both used to. Due to Covid I have only just been scheduled in for surgery in April.<br>
                        So we have finally set a date this year to renew our vows with family and friends. Of course apart from our witnesses no one is aware we are actually married. In saying that we were hoping you are available Saturday, 4 December to perform our ceremony.<br>
                        Kind regards
                     </p>

                        Married life has been absolutely fantastic - far better than I could have ever imagined (and this is my 3rd marriage)!<br>
                        We are blissfully happy and contented.<br>
                        We have bought a block of land just 20 metres from the ocean in Cebu and are bow building a big tropical house with a pool.<br>

                        I guess our advice to people about to get married is to take the focus off the "wedding" and put that focus on the "marriage" instead.<br><br>
                        We see these huge fancy weddings, and people walk away talking about the food, or the dancing, or uncle bobs drunken speech.<br><br>
                        People walked away from ours talking about how intimate, close and loving it was. It was one day, and we put the same effort into each other every single day as we did that day.<br><br>
                        Thank you for the wonderful memory of our wedding day. It was magic!
