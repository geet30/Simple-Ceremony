                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">If you have not arrived within <span class="body-1">10 minutes</span> of the start of your ceremony time, we will need to re-schedule your ceremony. You will need to rebook at the additional full fee for your ceremony. If the celebrant is able to delay their departure or return at a later time that day, they will, however the full fee will need to be paid again in full. When planning your ceremony please keep in mind that the celebrant will need to leave no later than 30 minutes after your booked <span class="body-1">start</span> time. Please ensure you and your guests are ready to commence at the time you have booked your ceremony.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">3. Number of guests</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">Each location has a <a href="/faq" class="button-1 turquoise-100 faq-link">set number of guests</a> that can attend. This must be adhered to. If the numbers exceed this we reserve the right not to proceed with your ceremony.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">4. Confetti</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">Park Ceremonies. The Council does not allow the throwing of rice, confetti, glitters, sprays, poppers or streamers. Instead you are encouraged to use more natural alternatives such as petals and/or bubbles. All petals must be removed after the ceremony. Synthetic petals are prohibited.</p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">5. Park Locations</h4>
                  <p class="body-3-regular mb-3">We have selected beautiful parks, for your ceremony, that do not incur a fee or require any specific booking - this keeps the price down. As such, we can't guarantee their condition or that they will always be available, due to their maintence.<br><br>
                  If we consider they may not be suitable we will contact you to let you know. We will provide you will an equivalent location at the same date and time (price, proximity and view).<br><br>
                  Please feel free to discuss prior to your booking.
                  </p>
                  <h4 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">6. Code of Practice</h4>
